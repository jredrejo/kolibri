Feature: Super admin imports content from Studio
    Super admin needs to be able to import content channels on the device from Kolibri Studio
    # The contents for the channels are shown as a tree of topics/subtopics with resources inside.
    # Use the "Khan Academy (English)" for testing because it takes a long time to load the channel listing.

  Background:
    Given there is no content from <channel> channel on the device
      And I am signed in to Kolibri as super admin, or a user with device permissions to import content
      And I am on the *Kolibri Studio* page with the list of available content *Channels*

    Then I see the list of subtopics for the <subtopic> subtopic
